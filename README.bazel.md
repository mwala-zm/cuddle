# Bazel workflows

This repository uses [Aspect Workflows](https://aspect.build) to provide an excellent Bazel developer experience.
## Formatting code

- Run `aspect run format` to re-format all files locally.
- Run `aspect run format path/to/file` to re-format a single file.
- Run `pre-commit install` to auto-format changed files on `git commit`.
- For CI verification, setup `format` task, see https://docs.aspect.build/workflows/features/lint#formatting


## Installing dev tools

For developers to be able to run a CLI tool without needing manual installation:

1. Add the tool to `tools/tools.lock.json`
2. `cd tools; ln -s _multitool_run_under_cwd.sh name_of_tool`
3. Instruct developers to run `./tools/name_of_tool` rather than install that tool on their machine.

See https://blog.aspect.build/run-tools-installed-by-bazel for details.


## Working with npm packages

To install a `node_modules` tree locally for the editor or other tooling outside of Bazel:

```
aspect run -- @pnpm --dir $PWD install
```

Similarly, you can run other `pnpm` commands to install or remove packages.
This ensures you use the same pnpm version as other developers, and the lockfile format will stay constant.




## Stamping release builds

Stamping produces non-deterministic outputs by including information such as a version number or commit hash.

To declare a build output which can be stamped, use a rule that is stamp-aware such as
[expand_template](https://docs.aspect.build/rulesets/aspect_bazel_lib/docs/expand_template).

Available keys are listed in `/tools/workspace_status.sh` and may include:

- `STABLE_GIT_COMMIT`: the commit hash of the HEAD (current) commit
- `STABLE_MONOREPO_VERSION`: a semver-compatible version in the form `2020.44.123+abc1234`

To request stamped build outputs, add the flag `--config=release`.
